I was seven when the first supermarket opened in my hometown. It was
around the time when Coca-Cola returned to India after nearly 15 years. Both
these things together - the first supermarket and Coke's return - seemed to get
the grown-ups excited. They'd never been too pleased about soft
drinks or junk food. And so an unusual family outing was
planned. There was a crowd outside the Coca-Cola stall. My parents even
ran into a few of their friends and their kids, which made it all the more
weird - a supermarket wasn't the kind of place where elders met for a
get-together. I remember feeling really disappointed at my first bottle of Coke.
I'd had soda before, but this one tasted like shit. I had yet to discover the
link between fried, salty food and carbonated drinks. But everyone
else, especially the elders seemed to like it. So I pretended to like it too. 

I grew fond of the supermarket, as it slowly replaced the neighborhood
grocery store. I forgot the name and the face of the neighborhood grocer, who was
fast approaching the designation of "my grandfather's grocer".
Supermarkets visits were exciting because it was fun to push the shopping cart. It
was easy to sneak packets of chocolate and potato wafers into the cart. They'd be
discovered only at checkout, by which time my mother would be too hassled
to not buy it.

Today, the only time I go to a grocery store is if I'm visiting something near
one. I've stopped going to supermarkets too - I'm completely dependent on
BigBasket and Blinkit. What's more surprising is that my
parents use these apps too. When they first visited Delhi after I'd moved here,
one of the first things they asked me was directions to the nearest grocery
store. I didn't know what to tell them. Their eyebrows disappeared when I told
them where the groceries _really_ came from.

"Even the fruits, vegetables, milk and eggs?!"

"Yes."

"How do you know they're not stale?"

"Well, as long as they don't stink..."

They gave each other the hopeless look that all children know so well.

I come from a long line of late adopters. Simon
Sinek [described](https://youtu.be/qp0HIF3SfI4?t=670) late adopters as the people who'd only buy a touchtone phone
because nobody would repair a rotary phone. That's exactly who my parents were. But now, post-COVID, they're different people. They're older,
they've lost some of their mobility, and their sons don't feel too enthusiastic pushing carts down the supermarket aisle. Now
they're quicker to use Blinkit than even I am. My mother even talks about instant delivery apps as if _she_
discovered them.

If a bunch of apps can change my mother's shopping habits - they can do anything.

In the past year alone, we have enough evidence of shopping apps changing the
market. In 2024, Swiggy went public, Zepto raised half a billon dollars, and
Flipkart and Bigbasket started operating in a visibly better manner. In April 2024,
Blinkit announced that they'd deliver a PlayStation 5 in ten minutes. To me the
idea was outrageous. As anyone from the erstwhile pre-liberalization middle
class knows, buying expensive items is a ritual. Buying expensive stuff in just
ten minutes - without months of research and penny pinching -  is just disrespectful.

I asked a lot of people about the most expensive thing they'd bought off an
insta-delivery app. I couldn't find anyone who'd spent more than a few thousand
rupees. A few people said they'd ordered protein powder or a video game
controller or a game (not the console itself). The most expensive item I
encountered was a UPS my wife bought for her office. But who would actually need a
PlayStation delivered in ten minutes? 

I spoke to [Deepak "Chuck" Gopalakrishnan](https://linkedin.com/in/chuckofalltrades) about this.
According to him, extravagant
offers are more marketing signals than revenue drivers - if someone claims they can
deliver expensive consoles in ten minutes, then they can certainly deliver groceries in time.
Perhaps, it takes signals like these to reach late adopters like my parents.
Many other customers like myself will sell their loyalty to a brand for a lot less.
Quick commerce to me is no longer a luxury, but an unequivocal default.

So when someone on LinkedIN [said that e-commerce apps are destroying traditional
kirana stores](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7290602148533321728/),
I wasn't surprised. On the contrary, I was sympathetic. The post
claimed that nearly 2,00,000 kirana stores had shut down in the last year
because of the 'predatory' practices of e-commerce companies. That's not a small
number. It means that the lives of at least 2,00,000 propreitors have been
affected - not to mention those of their staff and families. It won't be too far
fetched to say that at least a million people could have been affected by this,
either directly or indirectly.

But in a swift change of tone, the post went on to offer some solutions which, at
best, seemed like a rehash of management consulting jargon, and at worst,
sounded condescending. The post suggested that kirana stores can bridge the gap
with "tech integration", "omin-channel presence", "customer experience",
"training and upskilling", etc. Not only does this sound disingenuous by itself,
when used in the context of grocery stores, it also comes across as downright unprincipled.
I wish
someone would say these phrases out loud in a kirana store and record the
reactions. I then realized that the post was clickbaity to begin with. The
caption had the words "SHOCKING DATA" in the thumbnail, in a large font,
complete with the picture of an old man sitting behind the counter of a
customer-less store - only his face visible between jars of confectionery
and overhanging packets of chips.

Clearly, something was being sold to the reader. When a less-than-sincere sell
is coupled with clickbait, there's always something interesting under the hood.

## Under the Surface

The OP had cited no sources, even though they were a quick Google search away.
In October 2024, the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation
(AICPDF) reportedly wrote to various government bodies, including the
Competition Commission of India (CCI), complaining about the predatory practices
of e-commerce companies. Their letters or press releases aren't anywhere to be
found, but many media outlets have independently reported their claim
of [2,00,000 kirana stores shutting down in the last year](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/aicpdf-claims-rise-of-quick-commerce-economic-pressures-have-led-to-kirana-store-closures/article68805343.ece). It's safe to say that
this entire discussion stems from a claim.

But when we read the details of this claim, the picture becomes less bleak. 
The country apparently has 13 million kirana stores. So 2,00,000 of
them shutting down is a 1.5% reduction. Further, if we were to limit the numbers only to metros,
the cloure rate rises only up to 5%. It would be tempting to think that this is
a small fraction, but that _may_ be a mistake, since we don't know what the
usual rate of closures is - we don't know what the default benchmark is. It's
quite likely that the OP is right, and that 5% kirana stores shutting down in
metros is indeeed "SHOCKING DATA". But the claim that this is happening solely
because of e-commerce companies is certainly not beyond reasonable doubt. So I went
looking for something that would help me find the general, average success rates
of kirana stores.

Sadly, I could find no such resources. However, I did find that kirana stores
are no strangers to threats from e-commerce.

There are enough reports dating back to the 2010s which show that there have been [concerns
about supermarket chains](https://mobilityforesights.com/product/offline-grocery-market-in-india/) damaging Kirana stores (it was the heyday of Big Bazaar and D-Mart).
Later in the late 2010s, Amazon and Flipkart became a concern, but they
didn't manage to displace more than 1-2% of traditional kirana stores. Even when the
lockdown came, e-commerce managed to displace about half a percent of kirana stores. In this light,
it's reasonable to assume that while the figure of 2,00,000 looks big -
it's certainly not an outlier. It is also noteworthy that as much as there are
stories of concern towards e-commerce, there are stories of the triumph of kirana
stores too! PhonePe claimed, in 2021, to have [digitized 25 million "kirana stores and small merchants."](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/sme-msme-tech-phonepe-says-it-has-digitised-25-million-kiranas-merchants-in-india-2379513/)

By now it's clear that grocery stores have survived many threats. In business
(especially one as price-sensitive as FMCG retail) as well as in technology,
nearly every decade brings a new supposed threat. Morgan Housel wrote in is
book, _Same as Ever_, "It's good to always assume the world will break about
once per decade, because historically it has."[^1] Thankfully, Kirana stores are
resilient.

But no matter how much of a threat or opportunity anyone may believe e-commerce to be,
the discourse so far has been purely theoretical - based only on claims,
counterclaims and conjecture. There are bigger issues to resolve, like identifying
the true _impact_ of e-commerce on grocery shopping. To answer this, we turn to
the Household Consumer Expenditure Survey (HCES).

## Digging Deeper

HCES 2023-24 was conducted between August 2023 and July 2024. The survey
interviewed nearly a million individuals across almost 2,50,000 representative
households[^2]. A huge part of the survey deals with groceries[^3], including some
auxiliary information on payment methods and use of welfare schemes.

It is only in the context of the HCES microdata that I found the caption
"SHOCKING DATA!" to be truly justified. For instance, **only 7% of households in
the country shop online for groceries**[^4]! And of those households, more than half
are located in metros and a few Tier-I cities, across only four states.

![](online-grocery-shopping.png)

Online grocery shopping is a predominantly urban phenomenon, and saying even
that is a stretch. A whopping 83% of even _urban_ households don't shop online!
Recall AICPDF's claim of 5% of kirana stores shutting in metros. The numbers are
far too lopsided on the side of traditional grocery shopping to consider
e-commerce as a serious threat. Other than traditional grocery stores, the
survey also contains details of other ways in which consumers can procure
groceries, like subsidized rations, the Public Distribution System and the
Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana.

The survey shows such a huge diversity in what and how Indians eat, that it's almost
impossible to pinpoint the habits of an average Indian grocery shopper. For
those of us who, like [Amit Tandon says](https://x.com/amitandon/status/1880138635607241170), order the bread after they break the
eggs, who instinctively start looking at a QR code whenever we
but something from a brick-and-mortar store, it's impossible to imagine who the "offline consumer" really is.

![](kaun-hai-yeh-log.gif)

The HCES allows us to divide the respondents into cohorts of online and offline shoppers.
The imbalance between the sizes of these cohorts is massive, but when we adjust for size, 
we find some significant markers of difference. For example, living in a home
which has access to piped cooking gas makes you four times more likely to shop online
than if you cooked with firewood, biogas or even LPG. When we move from the cohort of graduates to
postgraduates, the odds of finding online shoppers are doubled.

![](hces-range-chart.png)

In this light, the conflict between e-commerce and kirana stores seems to be
insignificant. In fact, it seems like the real conflict is between
e-commerce and lack of urban infrastructure, lack of quality education and
massive income inequality. Consider this: if e-commerce
can only target 7% of Indian households, and if most Indians have no
discretionary spending power - who's the one who is _really_ in trouble?
Certainly not the kirana store. The well meaning folk who urge traditional stores to
"bridge the gap" with "tech integration" and "onmi-channel presence" might be
better off directing their wisdom elsewhere.

## Zooming Out

Even with all the number crunching, we're still looking at consumers simply as weighted sums
of statistical attributes. The real Indian consumer still remains elusive, if
there even is such a thing. The common consumer, then, becomes a mere metaphor in public discourse.

The Marathi movie _Half Ticket_ shows such a metaphor. It's a story of two
slumdwelling kids who steal eggs from crows' nests, because they can't afford
chicken eggs. The park from where they get these eggs is sold off and turned
into a pizza joint. The kids then get obsessed with eating a pizza. They work
odd jobs for weeks, trying to save up the 300 rupees for a pizza. When they're
ready to order one, they realize that it can't be delivered to their home,
because their address is simple the name of the _jhuggi_ where they live. They
have no house number and no street name. When they visit the store, they're
humiliated and thrown out because of their appearance. They go back to work and
save more money to buy better clothes. When they return to the store they're
thrown out once again - the guard _knows_ they are slum dwellers.
The movie does have a happy ending, the kids do get their pizza,
but only because someone thinks that feeding a couple of poor kids is good PR.
They have baggage that, even with money and clean clothes, cannot be jettisoned.

It's like there's an [entirely different country](https://youtu.be/PrHKt0HjmjA) living within India. I
myself am squarely in the 7%, and there's a whole world out there which I'll
never see, no matter how hard I look. 

But I certainly wouldn't presume to sell anti-e-commerce solutions to kirana stores.
Much less on social media of all places, with clickbait and alarmist captions.
