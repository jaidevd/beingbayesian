I don't think a lot of non-programming people understand flow and uninterrupted
immersion. Most of the gen pop is unsympathetic and oblivious to it. Even
spouses, unfortunately. In social conversation, it's so hard to defend not

## [June Huh's story](https://www.quantamagazine.org/june-huh-high-school-dropout-wins-the-fields-medal-20220705/)

On any given day, he does about three hours of focused work.
“Doing something that’s valuable, meaningful, creative” — or a task that he
doesn’t particularly want to do, like scheduling those appointments — “takes
away a lot of your energy.”

It took Huh six years to graduate.

June Huh is the poster child of slow productivity.
This brings in Cal Newport and perhaps even Richard Hamming

  - Subrahmanyan made two different statements - one for white collar workers

  - Attack on labour rights
  - Working class: Can't find workers because they're too comfortable where they
    live - maybe because of welfare schemes.
  - The onslaught of the neoliberal project
  - Are construction workers really fewer? After demonetization, the rural
    economy was hit hard. Fewer jobs in villages. So, huge migration to cities,
    especially of women.
  - The manufacuting and now the service sector has not been able to generate
    enough jobs. The growth story is sexy, but the employment is exploitative.
  - For workers moving out of the agriculture sector, construction is an
    attractive option. Most of employment in construction is informal. There's
    no security or benefits. A large, vulnerable workforce.
  - Huge number of women there.
  - GST was another policy shock which shoved more people into the construction
    sector.
  - COVID pandemic - another shock. The reverse migration. Is it really true
    that this reverse migration hit the construction sector equally hard across
    all classes? No. It's only the women who aren't coming back. (It was 5%,
    grew to 15% and is not at 3%)
  - On the other hand, the proportion of men has increased. So Subrahmanyan's
    complaint isn't about lack of labour, it's about lack of _cheap_ labour.
  - Toxic productivity, looking down upon work-life balance, and the increase in
    suicides and stress related diseases. All in the name of nationalism. Long
    work hours are in the interest of the nation. A bigger national problem is
    that of unemployment.

Raj Shamani & Krish Ashok
Q: Why do we not like processed or refrigerated food?
A: There's a lot of evidence that processed food is bad for you. No question
there.
Q: It's expensive too. Fresh food is cheaper.
A: Because it's the result of free labour. Processed food is cheaper, actually -
economics of scale. But there's free labour at home - so everything is cheap.
Q: That sounds so wrong.
A: Come on, time has a cost. The free labour your mothers and wives put in has a
cost. In fact, some Nordic countries want to measure the cost of unpaid labour
on the GDP. A lot of male success relies on a lot of things being the wife's problem.
Every time there's a new technology that reduces the time women spend in the
kitchen, there will be a generation of men extolling the virtues of the
primitive cooking practices. Not men, patriarchal culture, to be fair.
Mothers-in-law, and even mothers say this sometime.

# Breakable Things

Stuff that breaks is usually a symptom of a larger problem. In software, things
break because of bad design. Programmers either improve the design or they build
around it. Good programmers sometimes embrace the brokenness of things they
can't fix. Instead of covering them, they proudly display the cracks front and
center. They understand that refusing to solve a problem is as much good design
as a solution. This is also why hackers are sometimes valued more than
engineers. They don't fix the underlying problem - they just make things work.
Whatever doesn't work doesn't have to be swept under the rug - it becomes a
signature. A hacker knows what they cannot fix, without guilt.

In life, as in software, things break too. Bodies, minds, relationships and
routines are all so easily breakable that it's a wonder we function at all. And
so we have _life hacks_ - solutions to deeper problems that are almost
necessarily inelegant. It's easy to see why they are appealing. Fundamental
fixes to life's problems are hard - entire religions could thrive for centuries
and not solve them. Life hacks are seductively easier. For the most part, they
are _just enough_.

In the last seven years, I've broken things thrice. Not irreparably so, and
certainly not in a manner that should evoke sympathy - far from it, I'm better
for the breakages. But each time brought about a significant change in how I
look at my health, work, relationships and most of all - my _time_.

Before things broke the first time, life was sorted. There was an easy job, a
commute of predictable duration, and otherwise a fixed routine. The wife was
similarly busy. We would see each other only at dinner and on weekends. Even the
time spent on leisure was fixed - reading on the train, Netflix during dinner
and video games and socializing over the weekends. It had been like that for
three years at that point. It was comfortable. It never occurred to me that it
could be suboptimal. No thoughts of optimization or efficiency crossed my mind.

And then I took a new job. It was a dream job - the kind that you think you'll
spend the rest of your life at. But they only a small team and no office in
Delhi, so I ended up working from home. For the first time in life, I had more
time than I knew what to do with. More time is always a good thing, but only if
you know what to do with it. Initially all the extra time felt like a great
luxury. Like any dutiful knowledge worker, most of it went into doing extra
work. I quickly emerged as the new guy who gives more than 100%. It would take
me a long time to realize that being that guy has diminising marginal utility.
But in the meantime, I had a reputation. Now, I'd always been a workaholic but
upholding my reputation at work meant that I had to squeeze every last droplet
of time and siphon it into work. This, in turn, meant that there was less time
for everything else - especially leisure and relationships. And, naturally, all
concerned parties grew irritable, bitter and unhappy - in that order. This was
classic burnout, but, in my infinite hubris, I refused to admit it even to
myself. Finally, as a self-respecting hacker, instead of solving the root cause
of burnout, I avoided it altogether with hacks - productivity hacks.

So began my long relationship with personal productivity. Back then it wasn't
quite the global enterprise it is today - one that commands a lot of influence.
Sadly the people wielding that influence seem to suffer from the Kardashain
effect - they are productive at creating content about productivity[^1]. My
journal entries from that period (journalling, too, was something that mindful
and productive people recommended - I didn't start enjoying it until much later)
are full of whining about how I couldn't get enough done. Ultimately, many
books, articles, podcasts and videos later, I gave up on productivity hacks[^2].

This was the second time something broke. All hacks broke. Routine broke.
Habits, albeit with a lot of effort, broke. The only "hack" that remained was to
work with depth and focus at a slow and steady pace. It worked well enough for
me to do some of my best work: I went back to school and took some backbreaking
courses. I broke records at work - beat industry benchmarks, designed and built
systems that help millions of people. My wife and I built a forever home and
raised a dog. After all this, there were two things I thought I'd never go back
to - complaining about lack of time and productivity hacks.

And then after six years of working from home, I got a new job. This time at a
company that had an office nearby. My office used to be twenty feet from my
bedroom - now it was a twenty minute drive away. I know, a twenty minute commute
in Delhi is a goddamn luxury compared to what most people have to do. But when
you've been working from home for that long, every step outside is tiring.
Moreover, my new job was with a young company - for most of my colleagues it was
their first job. They were a highly energetic bunch with whom I had to really
work to keep up. It was like starting to go to a gym after a long gap -
exhausting but refreshing. The feeling of intense upheaval lasted about a month;
and was fortunately buffered by the excitement of a new job, new colleagues, new
office, and the sastisfaction of having an entirely new realm of programming
problems to solve. On the other hand, everyone at home - my wife, dog and the
help - had to get accustomed to me not being around. My dog was the worst hit -
in the first few weeks she lost her appetite. She had spent her entire life
lounging in my home office; either under my desk or on the sofa. She doesn't
mind staying there alone, but I could tell that she missed me being in that
room. For my house help, this meant extra hours (and also a raise) to
accommodate my schedule. For my driver, it mean juggling both my and my wife's
commute. My routine seemed like it had broken irreparably once again. Whatever I
had learned from my meanderings in time management and personal productivity
over the last six years seemed to have been overfitted to someone who works from
home. Now I had to rebuild it all over again.

Against this backdrop I saw the famous clip of S. N. Subrahmanyan, the L&T
chairman, wondering how long spouse can stare at each other. He wanted people to
work 90 hours a week. His comments came close on the heels of Narayana Murthy's
recommendation of a 70 hour workweek. These gentlemen are clearly very smart and
very successful. They both come from humble backgrounds. So it stands to reason
that they know what they are talking about. I'm sure that between them, they can
write volumes on productivity hacks.

As for myself, I wonder what I would have to do to work 90 hours a week. Not
starting at one's wife is perhaps, while initially painful, a manageable
productivity hack. But that doesn't me save too much time because my wife
herself is not sitting around waiting to be stared at. And moreover, we are once
again seeing each other only at dinner. Well, I could skip dinner. I could sleep
less. I could walk my dog only once a day. I could drink my morning coffee
during the commute instead of in my living room. I don't need multiple hours for
my hobbies r exercise either. There certainly is a lot of time to be saved, but
I know the cost. I know exactly what I would have to give up in order to work 90
hours a week.

Let's take a look at what other people would have to give up in order to work
that long.


# TUS Investigation

The 2024 Time Use Survey covers the entire country apart from some inaccessible
parts of Andaman & Nicobar, and is administered over the whole year to account
for seasonal variations. For each respondent, it records the time spent on
_everything_ in the last 24 hours in 30 minute intervals. As such, it presents a
exceptionally detailed view of how people spend their time. The
survey data is rich beyond an analyst's dreams... after losing myself for weeks
in the labyrinth of the various possibilities of filtering the data and designing
sample cohorts, I've settled down on a ruthlessly simplified but still rigorous
approach to the data.

For one, I will be writing about that subset of the population which is most
likely to be at the recieving end of productivity-shaming: salaried white-collar workers. 
The TUS helpfully includes a field which
records whether each respondent was involved in an economic activity, and if so,
whether they were self-employed or salaried. In addition, the survey also
records the industrial classification (NIC 2008) of the relevant economic activity.
With a combination of these two and the typical working age (15-60
years), I created filters which indicate whether someone can be asked to work
for 90 hours a week with a straight face.

Even this modestly-sized sample of the white-collar workforce is still quite
fertile. Fortunately, there's no demographic which is excluded from it. People
of all religions, castes, educational backgrounds, ages and genders (three of them) find decent
representations in the sample. Of these, some are more indicative (meaning,
correlated with) the use of time in specific activities than others, as we shall
see. The effects of some of these demographic variables are subtle, they show up
only in very nuanced conditions and with smaller effects. Others jump right off
the computer screen. The biggest example of the latter is gender. The _fact_
that time use is gendered wouldn't surprise anyone, but the _extent_ of the
effect of gender is staggering. Gender beats all other attributes of the
respondent by far, and there's no way you can manipulate the data
which makes this effect disappear.

![](assets/week.png)

If we simply look at the average time men and women spend on different types of
activities and adjust it for the week, the picture doesn't look bad at all. Both
men and women spend about 85 hours a week on self-care and maintenance. This
includes activities like sleep, personal care and hygiene and non-social eating
and drinking. Men work nearly 56 hours a week, and women work 48.6 hours a week.
This translates into women working only an hour less than men every day. If
you've wondered if your female colleagues seem to consistently leave the office
earlier, here is statistical proof.

It's in the next category of activities that things get interesting. Women spend
four times as much time on chores (they're designated as "unpaid domestic services for
household and family members" under ICATUS) than men. Activities under this
category involve working in the kitchen, doing the laundry and other
miscellaneous household management. In our quest for the 90 hour workweek, it's
pointless to look at anything but the largest component of chores, and that is
the kitchen. 

![](assets/kitchen.png)

Here, too, the magnitude is more surprising than the direction. We'd expect that
men spend much less time in the kitchen than women overall in the country - and
we'd be right. But to see that happen even in the a small, presumably
emancipated section of the population is shocking. Even among the salaried class
with skilled jobs, men barely spend an hour cooking. Moreover, cooking is only
a part of kitchen work - there are also the allied activities of serving food and
cleaning up after, where men are insultingly absent. This is reminiscent of a
scene from the Malayalam movie _The Great Indian Kitchen_ (which was also
captured well in it's Hindi remake) where an overbearing relative decides to
make dinner and leaves the kitchen in a mess.

Other factors associated with kitchen time - like marital status, education and
household weath - also influence it in expected ways. But the relationship
between them and time spent in the kitchen isn't just monotonic - it is
_extreme_. The women who come from the wealthiest quartile spend nearly three
hours less in the kitchen than those from the second wealthiest quartile. Women
with graduate degrees spend nearly 12.5 hours per week in the kitchen, and as
education drops to higher secondary, the time spent almost _doubles_. Going from
being single to being married increases the time spent in the kitchen by a
whopping ten hours per week.

The time spent in chores (particularly in the
kitchen and otherwise in cleaning and laundry) is inversely correlated to the
presence of labour-saving devices and methods in the household. This is not
surprising, but it _is_ statistically significant. What is surprising is that
these devices don't have as large an effect as we'd expect. Come to think of it,
washing machines, refrigerators, microwave ovens and vacuum cleaners are
technologies that are old enough to have revolutionized chores. They are
generally reasonably priced, too. Given that we're talking about a relatively
better off section of the population - why don't we see a larger effect? I don't
have a clear answer, but I did get a very interesting perspective from Krish
Ashok, in one of his most interesting podcast moments...

> ...optimizing cooking time with appliances is a progression. My grandfather

Anyhow, for the sake of argument, let us allow ourselves, for the time being, to
dream of a world where both men and women spend significantly less time on
chores. Let's say, optimistically, that both genders spend no more than an hour
a day on chores, and pump all the remaining time into work. Even in this
ridiculous world, women's work time would grow only to 67 hours a week. The
situation for men would not change since they already work less than an hour per
day on chores. To hit the 90 hour / week target, there's still a large deficit -
22 hours for women and 34 hours for men. At this point, work has no choice but
to eat into sleep and leisure.

![](assets/remaining-time.png)

This is probably the only chart in my entire analysis which looks gender
balanced. In fact the only small imbalance I see is that men watch TV for a
couple of hours longer than women (presumably when their wives are in the
kitchen). Otherwise both genders spend comparable amounts of time sleeping,
talking, eating and otherwise chilling. It must be noted, however, that I've
wrought an anomaly here by cherrypicking a specific cohort - otherwise, in general,
time spent on leisure and self-care is also heavily gendered. For instance,
women take 2.3 times as long as men to use the toilet - there's no way that
personal care and hygiene costs both genders the same amount of time across the
country. Even socialization and
relaxing can mean different things to both genders. In her book _Whole Numbers and
Half Truths_, Rukmini S writes some very interesting examples of how leisure
means different things to different sets of Indians, particularly to men and
women.

But as far as this cohort of salaried white-collar workers is concerned, this
chart tells us that there's a lot of productivity still to be squeezed out. For
example, both men and women could do with an hour less of sleep everyday. For
one, seven hours a night is by no means cruelly short. For another, every
productivity guru worth their salt will tell you that it's the quality of
sleep that matters more than the duration. That's seven hours added to the respective deficits right there! 

When it comes to talking, chatting and texting, 15 hours a week looks
downright excessive. All 10-12 hours of watching TV could be cut down. There's
certainly some some creative incentive that managers can come up with to get
people to cancel their Netflix subscriptions and delete their Instagram
accounts. In fact I'll go so far as to say that even personal care and hygiene
can be sacrificed. Ask Bhavish Agarwal - for someone who claims to work 20 hours
a day, he certainly looks quite well groomed. Of course, haters could always
ask why 20 hours a day isn't enough for him to make his customers happy. If
we're going to make reasonable arguments that time spent on work is no guarantee
of quality, this whole post is moot.

A colleague of mine once took a picture of a couple of his teammates sitting with
their laptops open in the back of an autorickshaw, all in the middle of a busy
Hyderabad street. The marketing team picked it up and used it in a social media
campaign with hashtags like #hustle, #dedication, #productivity, etc. All I
could think of was what a potential client might think about the quality of our
work if we were so busy hustling.

Another colleague once posted a picture of himself sitting on his desk, hunched up
over his laptop with the
caption, "burning the midnight oil after everyone has gone home." Someone
asked him who took the picture if everyone had gone home. He didn't reply.

I don't honestly think that people actually confuse time with productivity.
Nobody is that stupid. But knowledge workers aren't turning out widgets on an
assembly line. Time spent is perhaps the only lead metric of productivity we have.

The single most enjoyable thing about being a programmer is the obsessive
pursuit of a complex problem. Every good programmer has a lot of experience
with spending hours and days holed up in a room with an unhealthy disregard
for food, sleep and general well-being. It is the cost of what we do. It is why
we're able to take any pride in our craft. It's the rite of passage of every
true hacker. And they suffer from it, too. I recently ran into some old
friends at a conference. A decade ago, we could talk of nothing but the hustle.
This time we only complained about our backs, our necks and our cholesterol
levels. So, I understand only too well the appeal of working longer hours. It's not that
I'd never sell long hours to my younger colleagues.

But I see bullshit when I see it. Long hours were never sold to me on a
platter of nation building. It took me a while, but I recognized what enables
me to work long hours - I acknowledged my privilege. And the best way to sum up
the acknowledgement is this quote from Stephen King:

> The combination of a healthy body and a stable relationship with a
> self-reliant woman who takes zero shit from me or anyone else has made the
> continuity of my working life possible.

But when people ask you to work ridiculously long hours, healthy bodies and stable
relationships are exactly the kinds of things they want you to give up.

It will never work.

- John Steinbeck, _The Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters_

I shared this quote with my wife once. She said, "It's almost as if you dictated
this to Steinbeck." It was easily the most flattering thing anyone had ever said
to me. But as I visibly gloated, she added that she didn't mean it as a
compliment.

We had recently had an argument about something... I don't remember exactly what
it was. But it was something to do with home improvement... something like
doorknobs or curtain rods. Whatever it may have been about, at the core of it
was an ideological difference. My wife believes that no matter how small an
inconvenience is, it should be immediately addressed - _immediately_ being the
operative word. On the other hand, I think that most small inconveniences can
wait. In fact, I firmly believe that just because something is doable doesn't
mean it ought to be done. There's an infinite number of doable things. Undoable
things on the other hand are very few. There's nothing inherently special about
most things that are considered doable.

By now, she is bursting at the seams - with just a little amusement and a whole
lot of hopelessness. She reminds me that the whole issue is a lot simpler than
I'm making it - it's all about a few stupid doorknobs. Why can't I just fix them
_today_? I don't know what to say. The answer is actually pretty straightforward
- interruptions have a cost. And for programmers (I work from home),
  interruptions are unaffordable. When I can't explain why I don't particularly
  care about what I wear or eat - it's the same basic principle. Decisions have
  a cost too, no matter how trivial. But there's no way I can say this to
  someone, let alone my significant other, without sounding like a pompous,
  self-important jerk.

So the path of least resistance is to just fix the doorknobs. But close on the
doorknobs' heels are door stoppers which the dog chewed off, the sofa cushions
with only the smallest visible tears, the printer cartridge refills and the
endless stream of tiny decisions...

It wasn't always like this. A decade ago, life was just _sorted_. There was an
easy job, a commute of predictable duration, and otherwise a fixed routine. The
wife was similarly busy. We would see each other only at dinner and on weekends.
Even the time spent on leisure was fixed - reading on the train, Netflix during
dinner and video games and socializing over the weekends. Doorknobs were
strictly the landlords' headache. And the landlords, too, were reasonable enough
in the first place[^1]. It was all very comfortable. It never occurred to me
that the routine could be suboptimal. No thoughts of optimization or efficiency
crossed my mind.

And then something broke. I didn't quite know what.

I took a new job. It was a dream job - the kind that
you think you'll spend the rest of your life at. They only a small team and no
office in Delhi, so I ended up working from home. For the first time in life, I
had more time than I knew what to do with. Initially all the extra time felt
like a great luxury. Like any dutiful knowledge worker, most of it went into
doing extra work. I quickly emerged as the new guy who gives more than 100%. In
a couple of years I found that being that guy has diminising marginal utility.
But by then I already had a reputation at work - and upholding it meant that I
had to squeeze every last droplet of time and siphon it into work. This, in
turn, meant that there was less time for everything else - especially leisure
and relationships. And, naturally, all concerned parties grew irritable, bitter
and unhappy - in that order. This was classic burnout, but, in my infinite
hubris, I refused to admit it even to myself. Finally, as a self-respecting
hacker, instead of solving the root cause of burnout, I avoided it altogether
with productivity hacks.

What had broken was _Time_ - my idea of it and how I used it.

Personal productivity wasn't yet the widely influential global enterprise it
is today. Sadly, the poeple wielding that influence today seem to suffer from
the Kardashian effect - they seem to be only productive at creating content at
productivity. My journal entries from that period (journalling, too, was something that mindful
and productive people recommended - I didn't start enjoying it until much later)
are full of whining about how I couldn't get enough done[^3]. Ultimately, many
books, articles, podcasts and videos later, I gave up on productivity hacks[^2].

This was the second time Time broke, coinciding with the COVID-19
lockdown. All hacks broke. Routine broke.
Habits, albeit with a lot of effort, broke. The only "hack" that remained was to
work with depth and focus at a slow and steady pace. Cal Newport would
eventually call this slow productivity. It worked well enough for
me to do some of my best work.

After all that breakage, what remains with me is small set of ideas - don't multitask,
deal with interruptions the best you can, sleep well, etc. I no longer claim or
aim to be the master of my time. It's not like I'm cured of the cosmic ulcer - far from it.
I just don't give a shit anymore.

Every now and then I see success stories of slow productivity - like that of
June Huh - a Fields medalist who took six years to graduate, who does only about
three hours of focused work everyday, and who is described as extremely slow and
methodical. There's a story about how he stapled together a makeshift blanket
because going to buy a proper blanket was too mentally exhausting. There's also
the story of the great Richard Hamming. In his classic lecture _You and Your
Research_, he advocates exceptional ambition, attitude and passion. His idea of
knowledge and productivity being like compound interest have stayed with me
since my college days. Hamming and Huh, both poster boys of deep work and slow
productivity. But there's also something else that's common between Huh and
Hamming - both their wives had to put up with their shennanigans. Huh admits
that his wife was disappointed at the lack of balance in his life. Hamming, too,
admits that he "sort of neglected" his wife sometimes, "You have to neglect
things if you intend to get what you want done."[^4]

If that's the cost of good work... thanks, but no thanks.
