- John Steinbeck, _The Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters_

I shared this quote with my wife once. She said, "It's almost as if you dictated
this to Steinbeck." It was easily the most flattering thing anyone had ever said
to me. But as I visibly gloated, she added that she didn't mean it as a
compliment.

We had recently had an argument about something... I don't remember exactly what
it was. But it was something to do with home improvement... something like
doorknobs or curtain rods. Whatever it may have been about, at the core of it
was an ideological difference. My wife believes that no matter how small an
inconvenience is, it should be immediately addressed - _immediately_ being the
operative word. On the other hand, I think that most small inconveniences can
wait. In fact, I firmly believe that just because something is doable doesn't
mean it ought to be done. There's an infinite number of doable things. Undoable
things on the other hand are very few. There's nothing inherently special about
most things that are considered doable.

By now, she is bursting at the seams - with just a little amusement and a whole
lot of hopelessness. She reminds me that the whole issue is a lot simpler than
I'm making it - it's all about a few stupid doorknobs. Why can't I just fix them
_today_? I don't know what to say. The answer is actually pretty straightforward
- interruptions have a cost. And for programmers (I work from home),
  interruptions are unaffordable. When I can't explain why I don't particularly
  care about what I wear or eat - it's the same basic principle. Decisions have
  a cost too, no matter how trivial. But there's no way I can say this to
  someone, let alone my significant other, without sounding like a pompous,
  self-important jerk.

So the path of least resistance is to just fix the doorknobs. But close on the
doorknobs' heels are door stoppers which the dog chewed off, the sofa cushions
with only the smallest visible tears, the printer cartridge refills and the
endless stream of tiny decisions...

It wasn't always like this. A decade ago, life was just _sorted_. There was an
easy job, a commute of predictable duration, and otherwise a fixed routine. The
wife was similarly busy. We would see each other only at dinner and on weekends.
Even the time spent on leisure was fixed - reading on the train, Netflix during
dinner and video games and socializing over the weekends. Doorknobs were
strictly the landlords' headache. And the landlords, too, were reasonable enough
in the first place[^1]. It was all very comfortable. It never occurred to me
that the routine could be suboptimal. No thoughts of optimization or efficiency
crossed my mind.

And then something broke. I didn't quite know what.

I took a new job. It was a dream job - the kind that
you think you'll spend the rest of your life at. They only a small team and no
office in Delhi, so I ended up working from home. For the first time in life, I
had more time than I knew what to do with. Initially all the extra time felt
like a great luxury. Like any dutiful knowledge worker, most of it went into
doing extra work. I quickly emerged as the new guy who gives more than 100%. In
a couple of years I found that being that guy has diminising marginal utility.
But by then I already had a reputation at work - and upholding it meant that I
had to squeeze every last droplet of time and siphon it into work. This, in
turn, meant that there was less time for everything else - especially leisure
and relationships. And, naturally, all concerned parties grew irritable, bitter
and unhappy - in that order. This was classic burnout, but, in my infinite
hubris, I refused to admit it even to myself. Finally, as a self-respecting
hacker, instead of solving the root cause of burnout, I avoided it altogether
with productivity hacks.

What had broken was _Time_ - my idea of it and how I used it.

Personal productivity wasn't yet the widely influential global enterprise it
is today. Sadly, the poeple wielding that influence today seem to suffer from
the Kardashian effect - they seem to be only productive at creating content at
productivity. My journal entries from that period (journalling, too, was something that mindful
and productive people recommended - I didn't start enjoying it until much later)
are full of whining about how I couldn't get enough done[^3]. Ultimately, many
books, articles, podcasts and videos later, I gave up on productivity hacks[^2].

This was the second time Time broke, coinciding with the COVID-19
lockdown. All hacks broke. Routine broke.
Habits, albeit with a lot of effort, broke. The only "hack" that remained was to
work with depth and focus at a slow and steady pace. Cal Newport would
eventually call this slow productivity. It worked well enough for
me to do some of my best work.

After all that breakage, what remains with me is small set of ideas - don't multitask,
deal with interruptions the best you can, sleep well, etc. I no longer claim or
aim to be the master of my time. It's not like I'm cured of the cosmic ulcer - far from it.
I just don't give a shit anymore.

Every now and then I see success stories of slow productivity - like that of
June Huh - a Fields medalist who took six years to graduate, who does only about
three hours of focused work everyday, and who is described as extremely slow and
methodical. There's a story about how he stapled together a makeshift blanket
because going to buy a proper blanket was too mentally exhausting. There's also
the story of the great Richard Hamming. In his classic lecture _You and Your
Research_, he advocates exceptional ambition, attitude and passion. His idea of
knowledge and productivity being like compound interest have stayed with me
since my college days. Hamming and Huh, both poster boys of deep work and slow
productivity. But there's also something else that's common between Huh and
Hamming - both their wives had to put up with their shennanigans. Huh admits
that his wife was disappointed at the lack of balance in his life. Hamming, too,
admits that he "sort of neglected" his wife sometimes, "You have to neglect
things if you intend to get what you want done."[^4]

If that's the cost of good work... thanks, but no thanks.

Now imagine my indignation when a captain of industry says that we've got to
work on Sundays, and that we've been staring at our spouses for far too long.
