# The Cosmic Ulcer

My wife and I recently had a... discussion. I don't exactly remember what it was
about. But it was something to do with home improvement... something like
doorknobs or curtain rods. Whatever it may have been about, at the core of it
was an ideological difference. My wife believes that even the smallest
inconvenience should be immediately addressed - _immediately_ being the
operative word. I, on the other hand, think that most small inconveniences can
wait. In fact, I firmly believe that just because something is doable doesn't
mean it ought to be done. There's an infinite number of doable things. Undoable
things, on the other hand, are very few. There's nothing inherently special about
most things that are considered doable.

Before I realize it, I'm actually saying all of this out loud with a lot of
sincerity. She initially finds it amusing: I can't be serious! How does
something as trivial as a broken doorknob push me into delivering a deep
metaphysical thesis? As I ramble on, her amusement becomes frustration. She
reminds me that the whole issue is a lot simpler than I'm making it - it's all
about a few stupid doorknobs. Why can't I just fix them _today_? I don't know
what to say.

The answer is actually pretty straightforward - interruptions have a cost.
And for programmers (I've been working from home for the last seven years),
interruptions are unaffordable. It takes programmers 10-15 to resume work
in earnest after being interrupted[^1]. My wife and my cook both know that
even the smallest, most straightforward question will garner an unfocused,
glassy-eyed stare, accompanied by a "huh...?!" So when I can't explain why I
don't particular care about what I eat or wear - it's the same basic principle.
Decisions, no matter how trivial, have a cost.

But there's no way I can say this to someone, let alone my significant other,
without sounding like a pompous, self-important jerk.

So the path of least resistance is to just fix the doorknobs. But close on the
doorknobs' heels are door stoppers the dog chewed off, the sofa cushions with
only the smallest visible tears, the printer cartridge refills and the endless
stream of tiny decisions...

> â€” John Steinbeck, *Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters*

I shared this quote with my wife once. She said, "It's almost as if you dictated
this to Steinbeck." It was easily the most flattering thing anyone had ever said
to me. But as I visibly gloated, she added that she didn't mean it as a
compliment.

It wasn't always like this. A decade ago, life was just _sorted_. Both of us had a
fairly predictable job, and a fixed routine. We would see each other only at dinner and on weekends.
Even the time spent on leisure was fixed - reading on the train, Netflix during
dinner and video games and socializing over the weekends. Doorknobs were
strictly the landlords' headache. It was all very comfortable. It never
occurred to me that the routine could be suboptimal. No thoughts of optimization
or efficiency crossed my mind.

And then something broke. I didn't quite know what.

I took a new job. It was a dream job - the kind that you think you'll spend the
rest of your life at. There was only a small team in Delhi and no office.
So I worked from home. For the first time in life, I had more time than I
knew what to do with. Initially all the extra time felt like a great luxury.
Like a dutiful worker, most of the leftover time went into doing extra work. I
quickly emerged as the new guy who gives more than 100%. I soon realized
that being that guy has diminishing marginal utility. But by then I already
had a reputation - and upholding it meant that I had to squeeze every
last droplet of time and siphon it into work. This, in turn, meant that there
was less time for everything else - especially leisure and relationships. And,
naturally, all concerned parties grew irritable, bitter and unhappy - in that
order. This was classic burnout, but, in my infinite hubris, I refused to admit
it even to myself. Finally, as a self-respecting hacker, instead of solving the
root cause of burnout, I avoided it altogether with productivity hacks.

What had broken was _Time_ - my idea of it and how I used it.

Personal productivity wasn't yet the widely influential global enterprise it is
today. Sadly, the people wielding that influence today seem to suffer from the
Kardashian effect - they seem to be only productive at creating content about
productivity[^2]. My journal entries from that period (journalling, too, was
something that productivity gurus recommended - I didn't start
enjoying it until much later) are full of whining about how I couldn't get
enough done. Ultimately I realized that my ideal day was getting more and more
ridiculous and impractical. The day would never come when I get up early,
do enough exercise, crack off a major work problem before lunch, read a book
in the late afternoon, work on a side project in the evening, take a leisurely
walk in the park with the dog, and top off the day with a deep conversation
over dinner. When I look back, I see that that was the last time I whined about
not getting enough done.  So, eventually, many books, articles, podcasts and videos later, I
gave up on productivity hacks[^3].

This was the second time Time broke, coinciding with the COVID-19 lockdown. All
hacks broke. Routine broke. Habits, albeit with a lot of effort, broke. The only
"hack" that remained was to work with depth and focus at a slow and steady pace.
Cal Newport would eventually call this slow productivity. It worked well enough
for me to do some of my best work.

After all that breakage, what remains with me is a small set of ideas - don't
multitask, deal with interruptions the best you can, sleep well, etc. I no
longer claim or aim to be the master of my time. It's not even like I'm cured of the
cosmic ulcer - far from it. I just care less now.

Every now and then I see success stories of slow productivity - small doses of
vindication for my rediscovered approach. A friend heard my rant about
doorknobs. He could not have been more sympathetic. He admitted that
non-programmers rarely understand flow and uninterrupted immersion, and how, in
social conversation it is difficult to defend not fixing a doorknob. He then
shared with me a [Quanta profile of June Huh](https://www.quantamagazine.org/june-huh-high-school-dropout-wins-the-fields-medal-20220705/).
"Somewhere here there's a story of a Fields medalist stapling together a makeshift blanket...", he said.
June Huh is a late blooming mathematician who dropped out of high school to
write poetry, then got enrolled in a math course, took six years to graduate and
finally went on to win the Fields medal. He is described as extremely slow and
methodical. He hacked together a blanket from scrap cloth because going to buy a
proper blanket was too mentally exhausting. I somehow just _get_ that.

There's also the story of the great Richard Hamming. In his classic lecture [_You
and Your Research_](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html), he advocates exceptional ambition, attitude and passion. His
idea of knowledge and productivity being like compound interest has stayed with
me since my college days.

Both Hamming and Huh are poster boys of deep work and slow productivity. But
there's also something else that's common between Huh and Hamming - both their
wives had to put up with their shenanigans. Huh admits that his wife was
disappointed at the lack of balance in his life. Hamming, too, admits that he
["sort of neglected"](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html#:~:text=I%20don%27t%20like%20to%20say%20it%20in%20front%20of%20my%20wife%2C%20but%20I%20did%20sort%20of%20neglect%20her%20sometimes%3B%20I%20needed%20to%20study.) his wife sometimes, "You have to neglect things if you
intend to get what you want done."[^4]

It's infuriating how, even with the best of intentions on your part, there's
always someone else paying the price of your productivity - a parent, a spouse,
a child or a pet.

So now imagine my indignation when a captain of industry tells me that I ought to
be working 90 hours a week, through weekends, and that I've been staring
at my spouse for too long.

# The War on Time

![](https://youtu.be/T4R0nIi_edU)

N R Narayana Murthy wants people to work 70 hours a week. And frankly, that
doesn't sound too bad. But S N Subrahmanyan dials it up to 90 hours a week.
Bhavish Aggarwal [claims to work 140 hours a week](https://youtu.be/hQSfHeaYREw). He believes that weekends and
work-life balance don't apply to Indians because they a western concept. He may
be right, but only a little homework would have revealed that the concept of
leisure isn't foreign at all. It is advocated in something quintessentially Indian -
the Constitution.

> The State shall endeavour to secure, by suitable legislation or economic
> organisation or in any other way, to all workers, agricultural, industrial or
> otherwise, work, a living wage, conditions of work ensuring a decent standard

> - Article 43, Directive Principles of State Policy

Now, credit where it is due, building and running an industrial empire must come
with a deep understanding of how people do their best work. But when
exhortations to work longer hours are accompanied by news of [stress-induced
diseases](https://www.britsafe.in/safety-management-news/2023/stress-at-work-india-inc-begins-to-take-action), [deaths](https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/ey-pune-employee-anna-sebastian-perayil-26-died-due-to-work-stress-no-one-from-ernst-young-attended-funeral-101726637649530.html) and even [suicides](https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/ola-employee-dies-by-suicide-due-to-work-pressure-company-says-he-was-on-personal-leave-101747560246585.html) in the workplace - it's clear that this
fanatical quest for workplace productivity is not just misguided, but also
tone-deaf. It is also, as we shall see, inevitably sexist.

# How the Salaried and Skilled India Works

Between January and December of 2024, the National Statistical Office conducted
the second national Time Use Survey (TUS) in India (The first  was conducted
in 2019, before the pandemic). It offers precisely the kind of data that helps
us address the question of how feasible long workhours are, and who they affect
the most. As I wrote the following section, the central guiding question in my
analysis was,

> If people had to work 90 hours a week, what would they have to give up?

The 2024 TUS covers the entire country apart from some inaccessible
parts of Andaman & Nicobar, and is administered over the whole year to account
for seasonal variations. For each respondent, it records the time spent on
_everything_ in the last 24 hours in 30 minute intervals. As such, it
presents a exceptionally detailed view of how people spend their time. The
survey data is rich beyond an analyst's dreams... after losing myself for
weeks in the labyrinth of the various possibilities of filtering the data
and designing sample cohorts, I've settled down on a ruthlessly simplified
but still rigorous approach to the data.

For one, I will be writing about that subset of the population which is most
likely to be at the receiving end of productivity-shaming: salaried white-collar
workers. The TUS helpfully includes a field which records whether each
respondent was involved in an economic activity, and if so, whether they were
self-employed or salaried. In addition, the survey also records the [industrial
classification](https://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/main_menu/national_industrial_classification/nic_2008_17apr09.pdf) of the relevant economic activity. With a combination
of these two and the typical working age (15-60 years), I created filters which
indicate whether someone can be asked to work for 90 hours a week with a
straight face[^5].

Even this modestly-sized sample of the white-collar workforce is still quite
fertile. Fortunately, there's no demographic which is excluded from it. People
of all religions, castes, educational backgrounds, ages and genders find decent representations in the sample. Of these, some are more
indicative (meaning, correlated with) the use of time in specific activities
than others, as we shall see. The effects of some of these demographic variables
are subtle, they show up only in very nuanced conditions and with smaller
effects. Others jump right off the computer screen. The biggest example of the
latter is gender. The _fact_ that time use is gendered wouldn't surprise anyone,
but the _extent_ of the effect of gender is staggering. Gender beats all other
attributes of the respondent by far, and there's no way you can manipulate the
data which makes this effect disappear[^6].

![](assets/week.png)

If we simply look at the average time men and women spend on different types of
activities and adjust it for the week, the picture doesn't look bad at all. Both
men and women spend about 85 hours a week on self-care and maintenance. This
includes activities like sleep, personal care, hygiene and non-social eating
and drinking. Men work nearly 56 hours a week, and women work 48.6 hours a week.
This translates into women working only an hour less than men every day. If
you've wondered if your female colleagues seem to consistently leave the office
earlier, here is statistical proof.

It is in the next category of activities that things get interesting. Women spend
four times as much time on chores (they're designated as "unpaid domestic
services for household and family members" under [ICATUS](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/timeuse/23012019%20ICATUS.pdf)) than men[^7]. Activities
under this category involve working in the kitchen, doing the laundry and other
miscellaneous household management. In our quest for the 90 hour workweek, it's
pointless to look at anything but the largest component of chores, and that is
the kitchen. 

![](assets/kitchen.png)

Here, too, the magnitude is more surprising than the direction. We'd expect that
men spend much less time in the kitchen than women overall in the country - and
we'd be right. But to see that happen even in a small, presumably
emancipated section of the population is shocking. Even among the salaried class
with skilled jobs, men barely spend an hour cooking. Moreover, cooking is only a
part of kitchen work - there are also the allied activities of serving food and
cleaning up after, where men are insultingly absent. This reminds me of a
scene from the Malayalam movie _The Great Indian Kitchen_ (which was also
captured well in it's Hindi remake) where an overbearing relative announces that
he's going to make dinner, that the women can rest, but ends up leaving the
kitchen in a mess.

Other factors associated with kitchen time - like marital status, education and
household wealth - also influence it in expected ways. But the relationship
between them and time spent in the kitchen isn't just monotonic - it is
_extreme_. The women who come from the wealthiest quartile spend nearly three
hours less in the kitchen than those from the second wealthiest quartile. Women
with graduate degrees spend nearly 12.5 hours per week in the kitchen, and as
education drops to higher secondary, the time spent almost _doubles_. Going from
being single to being married increases the time spent in the kitchen by a
whopping ten hours per week.

The time spent in chores (particularly in the kitchen and otherwise in cleaning
and laundry) is inversely correlated to the presence of labour-saving devices
and methods in the household. This is not surprising, but it _is_ statistically
significant. What is surprising is that these devices don't have as large an
effect as we'd expect. Come to think of it, washing machines, refrigerators,
microwave ovens and vacuum cleaners are technologies that are old enough to have
revolutionized chores. They are generally reasonably priced, too. Given that
we're talking about a relatively better off section of the population - why
don't we see a larger effect? I don't have a clear answer, but I did get a very
interesting perspective from Krish Ashok, in one of his most [interesting podcast
moments](https://youtu.be/Zf0idCv5BGU?t=1603)...

> ...optimizing cooking time with appliances is a progression. My grandfather

> generation of men and women resisting it...

Anyhow, for the sake of argument, let us allow ourselves, for the time being, to
dream of a world where both men and women spend significantly less time on
chores. Let's say, optimistically, that both genders spend no more than an hour
a day on chores, and pump all the remaining time into work. Even in this
ridiculous world, women's work time would grow only to 67 hours a week. The
situation for men would not change since they already work less than an hour per
day on chores. To hit the 90 hour / week target, there's still a large deficit -
22 hours for women and 34 hours for men. At this point, work has no choice but
to eat into sleep and leisure.

![](assets/remaining-time.png)

This is probably the only chart in my entire analysis which looks gender
balanced. In fact the only small imbalance I see is that men watch TV for a
couple of hours longer than women (presumably when their wives are in the
kitchen). Otherwise both genders spend comparable amounts of time sleeping,
talking, eating and otherwise chilling. It must be noted, however, that I've
wrought an anomaly here by cherrypicking a specific cohort - otherwise, in
general, time spent on leisure and self-care is also heavily gendered. For
instance, women take 2.3 times as long as men to use the toilet[^8] - there's no way
that personal care and hygiene costs both genders the same amount of time across
the country. Even socialization and relaxing can mean different things to both
genders. In her book _Whole Numbers and Half Truths_, Rukmini S writes some very
interesting examples of how leisure means different things to different sets of
Indians, particularly to men and women. Even something as innocuous as
commandeering the TV remote can affect how women feel about their freedom of
leisure.

But as far as this cohort of salaried white-collar workers is concerned, this
chart tells us that there's a lot of productivity still to be squeezed out. For
example, both men and women could do with an hour less of sleep everyday. For
one, seven hours a night is by no means cruelly short. For another, every
productivity guru worth their salt will tell you that it's the quality of sleep
that matters more than the duration. That's seven hours added to the respective
deficits right there! 

When it comes to talking, chatting and texting, 15 hours a week looks downright
excessive. All 10-12 hours of watching TV could be cut down. There's certainly
some creative incentive that managers can come up with to get people to
cancel their Netflix subscriptions and delete their Instagram accounts. In fact
I'll go so far as to say that even some personal care and hygiene can be sacrificed.
Ask Bhavish Aggarwal - for someone who claims to work 20 hours a day, he
certainly looks quite well groomed.  Of course, haters could always ask why 20
hours a day isn't enough for him to [make decent scooters](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/over-10k-consumer-complaints-against-ola-electric-in-last-1yr-ccpa-issues-notice-to-company/articleshow/114152740.cms). If we're going to make
reasonable arguments like time spent on work is no guarantee of quality, this
whole post is moot.

A colleague of mine once took a picture of a couple of his teammates sitting
with their laptops open in the back of an autorickshaw, in the middle of a
busy Hyderabad street. The marketing team picked it up and used it in a social
media campaign with hashtags like #hustle, #dedication, #productivity, etc. All
I could think of was what a potential client might think about the quality of
our work if we were so busy hustling.

Another colleague once posted a picture of himself sitting on his desk, hunched
up over his laptop with the caption, "burning the midnight oil after everyone
has gone home." Someone asked him who took the picture if everyone had gone
home. He didn't reply.

I don't honestly think that people actually confuse time with productivity.
Nobody is that stupid. But knowledge workers aren't turning out widgets on an
assembly line. Time spent is perhaps the only lead metric of productivity we
have.

The single most enjoyable thing about being a programmer is the obsessive
pursuit of a complex problem. Every good programmer has a lot of experience with
spending hours and days holed up in a room with an unhealthy disregard for food,
sleep and general well-being. It is the cost of what we do. It is why we're able
to take any pride in our craft. It's the rite of passage of every true hacker.
And they suffer from it, too. I recently ran into some old friends at a
conference. A decade ago, we could talk of nothing but the hustle. This time we
only complained about our backs, our necks and our cholesterol levels. So, I
understand only too well the appeal of working longer hours. It's not that I'd
never sell long hours to my younger colleagues.

But I see bullshit when I see it. Long hours were never sold to me on a platter
of nation building. It took me a while, but I recognized precisely what enables
me to work
long hours, and I acknowledged my privilege. I can think of no better
acknowledgement than this quote from Stephen King:

> The combination of a healthy body and a stable relationship with a
> self-reliant woman who takes zero shit from me or anyone else has made the
> continuity of my working life possible.
> - _On Writing_

But when people ask you to work ridiculously long hours, healthy bodies and
stable relationships are exactly the kinds of things they want you to give up.

It better be worth it.
