# TUS Investigation

The 2024 Time Use Survey covers the entire country apart from some inaccessible
parts of Andaman & Nicobar, and is administered over the whole year to account
for seasonal variations. For each respondent, it records the time spent on
_everything_ in the last 24 hours in 30 minute intervals. As such, it presents a
exceptionally detailed view of how people spend their time. The
survey data is rich beyond an analyst's dreams... after losing myself for weeks
in the labyrinth of the various possibilities of filtering the data and designing
sample cohorts, I've settled down on a ruthlessly simplified but still rigorous
approach to the data.

For one, I will be writing about that subset of the population which is most
likely to be at the recieving end of productivity-shaming: salaried white-collar workers. 
The TUS helpfully includes a field which
records whether each respondent was involved in an economic activity, and if so,
whether they were self-employed or salaried. In addition, the survey also
records the industrial classification (NIC 2008) of the relevant economic activity.
With a combination of these two and the typical working age (15-60
years), I created filters which indicate whether someone can be asked to work
for 90 hours a week with a straight face.

Even this modestly-sized sample of the white-collar workforce is still quite
fertile. Fortunately, there's no demographic which is excluded from it. People
of all religions, castes, educational backgrounds, ages and genders (three of them) find decent
representations in the sample. Of these, some are more indicative (meaning,
correlated with) the use of time in specific activities than others, as we shall
see. The effects of some of these demographic variables are subtle, they show up
only in very nuanced conditions and with smaller effects. Others jump right off
the computer screen. The biggest example of the latter is gender. The _fact_
that time use is gendered wouldn't surprise anyone, but the _extent_ of the
effect of gender is staggering. Gender beats all other attributes of the
respondent by far, and there's no way you can slice and dice the data
which makes this effect disappear.

If we simply look at the average time men and women spend on different types of
activities and adjust it for the week, the picture doesn't look bad at all. Both
men and women spend about 85 hours a week on self-care and maintenance. This
includes activities like sleep, personal care and hygiene and non-social eating
and drinking. Men work nearly 56 hours a week, and women work 48.6 hours a week.
This translates into women working only an hour less than men every day. If
you've wondered if your female colleagues seem to consistently leave the office
earlier, here is statistical proof.
