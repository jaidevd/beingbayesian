Writing prompts:

* The cosmic ulcer... Having not to decide what to wear or eat. Fixing doorknobs
  and choosing decoration.
* Interruptions and productivity.
* Being a good daughter-in-law.
* What do people have to take away from their schedule to have a 90 hr workweek?
* Being responsible for other living beings.

She: When I say, let's do the small doable things like changing doorknobs - why
can't you just be like, 'Yeah, let's do that!'

He: There are an infinite number of doable things. Impossible things, on
the other hand are very few. Therefore, anything can be called doable - there's
nothing special about most things that are considered doable.

She (hysterical by now): Why can't you just change the broken doorknob
in your bathroom?

He: I could just as well change door stoppers, hinges and the taps in the house.
Where does it stop? All of these are doable.

She: But none of them are _required_.

He (sensing that he's losing the argument, and trying to deflect): No, no...
let's first deal with this concept of the 'doable'. (Invoking Oliver Burkeman)
The human life is insultingly short. Just because things are doable does not
mean they ought to be done.

She (with infinite hopelessness): So you're not fixing the doorknob of your own bathroom?

Hi: Woh kya khazana hai jo kadi aur tala lagaun?

I don't think a lot of non-programming people understand flow and uninterrupted
immersion. Most of the gen pop is unsympathetic and oblivious to it. Even
spouses, unfortunately. In social conversation, it's so hard to defend not
fixing a doorknob. -- A Friend

## [June Huh's story](https://www.quantamagazine.org/june-huh-high-school-dropout-wins-the-fields-medal-20220705/)

On any given day, he does about three hours of focused work.
“Doing something that’s valuable, meaningful, creative” — or a task that he
doesn’t particularly want to do, like scheduling those appointments — “takes
away a lot of your energy.”

It took Huh six years to graduate.

June Huh is the poster child of slow productivity.
This brings in Cal Newport and perhaps even Richard Hamming

The shape of the prior:

1. Starts with Richard Hamming about neglecting stuff sometimes, to achieve
   great things. Sending this article to Aditi and her reaction.
2. Then John Steinbeck
3. Years later, I'm not fixing doorknobs and not spending enough time with her.
4. June Huh is who we all want to be.
5. And when I do get my leisure - I don't know what to do with it.

Even if I wanted to spend an inordinate amount of time with Aditi, India's
coroprate leaders don't like that. The head honco of L&T wants his employees
to work 90 hours a week. The CEO of Infosys wants his employees to work 70
hours a week. The L&T guy doesn't want people staring at their spouses.

How much time _do_ people have exactly?!

  - Women's paid labour force participation has a significant impact on GDP
   (p246)
  - Both the OECD and McKinsey have uncovered a strong negative correlation
   between time spent in unpaid care work and women's pair labour-force
   participation rate. (same page)
  - Although McKinsey estimates that women's unpaid care work contributes $10
   trillion to annual global GDP, trips made for paid work are still valued more
   than trips made for unpaid work. (p37)
  - The Frauen-Werk-Stadt I housing complex, designed to cater to women's caring
    needs. Because Austria's national statistics agency revealed that women
    spent more time per day than men on household chores and childcare. (p44)
  - women take up 2.3 times as long as men to use the toilet (p48)
  - girls and women collectively spend 97 billion hours a year finding a safe
    place to relieve themselves. (p49)
  - This affects women's paid labour: women make up 91% of the 86% of
    Indians who work in the informal economy. (same page)
  - ... the term 'working woman' as a tautology. There is no such thing as a
    woman who doesn't work. There's only a woman who isn't _paid_ for her work.
    (p70)
  - Even when men do increase their unpaid work, it isn't by doing the routine
    housework that forms the majority of the workload, insead creaming off the
    more enjoyable activities like childcare. On average 61% of housework is
    undertaken by women. In India, for example, five our of women's six daily
    hours of unpaid labour are spend on housework, compared to men's 13 minutes.
    (p71)
  - ... women are not the unencumbered workers the traditional workplace has
    been designed to suit, and that while men are more likely to fit into this
    automaton ideal, increasing numbers of them no longer want to.
  - Jim Brophy: Worker health should be a public health priority if only because
    'workers are acting as a canary for society as a whole'. (p129)
  - Women will often list their paid work as their secondary activity, simply
    because their unpaid work takes up so much time, but that doesn't mean that
    they aren't spending a substantial proportion of their day on paid work. The
    result is that labour-force statistics often sport a substantial gender data
    gap. (p148)
  - the toxicity of wood fire stoves / traditional stoves (p152)
  - The Indian program failed because maintenance is for men, and men couldn't
    be bothered to fix stoves. (p154)
  - Matriarchal households more likely to adopt cleaner cooking solutions than 
    patriarchal households. (p155)
* Avinash Kumar & Kunal Kamra
  - A very small fraction of the labour force is in the corporate or IT sectors.
    Even they are under the informal sector.
  - Fanatical quest for cheap labour. The head honchos are unhappy because of
    what comes with cheap labour.
  - Subrahmanyan made two different statements - one for white collar workers
    and the other for casual workers.
  - Attack on labour rights
  - Working class: Can't find workers because they're too comfortable where they
    live - maybe because of welfare schemes.
  - The onslaught of the neoliberal project
  - Are construction workers really fewer? After demonetization, the rural
    economy was hit hard. Fewer jobs in villages. So, huge migration to cities,
    especially of women.
  - The manufacuting and now the service sector has not been able to generate
    enough jobs. The growth story is sexy, but the employment is exploitative.
  - For workers moving out of the agriculture sector, construction is an
    attractive option. Most of employment in construction is informal. There's
    no security or benefits. A large, vulnerable workforce.
  - Huge number of women there.
  - GST was another policy shock which shoved more people into the construction
    sector.
  - COVID pandemic - another shock. The reverse migration. Is it really true
    that this reverse migration hit the construction sector equally hard across
    all classes? No. It's only the women who aren't coming back. (It was 5%,
    grew to 15% and is not at 3%)
  - On the other hand, the proportion of men has increased. So Subrahmanyan's
    complaint isn't about lack of labour, it's about lack of _cheap_ labour.
  - Toxic productivity, looking down upon work-life balance, and the increase in
    suicides and stress related diseases. All in the name of nationalism. Long
    work hours are in the interest of the nation. A bigger national problem is
    that of unemployment.
  - How many days per year do people have to work to meet their per capita GDP?
    How many days would they have had to work back in the day?

Raj Shamani & Krish Ashok
Q: Why do we not like processed or refrigerated food?
A: There's a lot of evidence that processed food is bad for you. No question
there.
Q: It's expensive too. Fresh food is cheaper.
A: Because it's the result of free labour. Processed food is cheaper, actually -
economics of scale. But there's free labour at home - so everything is cheap.
Q: That sounds so wrong.
A: Come on, time has a cost. The free labour your mothers and wives put in has a
cost. In fact, some Nordic countries want to measure the cost of unpaid labour
on the GDP. A lot of male success relies on a lot of things being the wife's problem.
Every time there's a new technology that reduces the time women spend in the
kitchen, there will be a generation of men extolling the virtues of the
primitive cooking practices. Not men, patriarchal culture, to be fair.
Mothers-in-law, and even mothers say this sometime.

# Breakable Things

Stuff that breaks is usually a symptom of a larger problem. In software, things
break because of bad design. Programmers either improve the design or they build
around it. Good programmers sometimes embrace the brokenness of things they
can't fix. Instead of covering them, they proudly display the cracks front and
center. They understand that refusing to solve a problem is as much good design
as a solution. This is also why hackers are sometimes valued more than
engineers. They don't fix the underlying problem - they just make things work.
Whatever doesn't work doesn't have to be swept under the rug - it becomes a
signature. A hacker knows what they cannot fix, without guilt.

In life, as in software, things break too. Bodies, minds, relationships and
routines are all so easily breakable that it's a wonder we function at all. And
so we have _life hacks_ - solutions to deeper problems that are almost
necessarily inelegant. It's easy to see why they are appealing. Fundamental
fixes to life's problems are hard - entire religions could thrive for centuries
and not solve them. Life hacks are seductively easier. For the most part, they
are _just enough_.

In the last seven years, I've broken things thrice. Not irreparably so, and
certainly not in a manner that should evoke sympathy - far from it, I'm better
for the breakages. But each time brought about a significant change in how I
look at my health, work, relationships and most of all - my _time_.

Before things broke the first time, life was sorted. There was an easy job, a
commute of predictable duration, and otherwise a fixed routine. The wife was
similarly busy. We would see each other only at dinner and on weekends. Even the
time spent on leisure was fixed - reading on the train, Netflix during dinner
and video games and socializing over the weekends. It had been like that for
three years at that point. It was comfortable. It never occurred to me that it
could be suboptimal. No thoughts of optimization or efficiency crossed my mind.

And then I took a new job. It was a dream job - the kind that you think you'll
spend the rest of your life at. But they only a small team and no office in
Delhi, so I ended up working from home. For the first time in life, I had more
time than I knew what to do with. More time is always a good thing, but only if
you know what to do with it. Initially all the extra time felt like a great
luxury. Like any dutiful knowledge worker, most of it went into doing extra
work. I quickly emerged as the new guy who gives more than 100%. It would take
me a long time to realize that being that guy has diminising marginal utility.
But in the meantime, I had a reputation. Now, I'd always been a workaholic but
upholding my reputation at work meant that I had to squeeze every last droplet
of time and siphon it into work. This, in turn, meant that there was less time
for everything else - especially leisure and relationships. And, naturally, all
concerned parties grew irritable, bitter and unhappy - in that order. This was
classic burnout, but, in my infinite hubris, I refused to admit it even to
myself. Finally, as a self-respecting hacker, instead of solving the root cause
of burnout, I avoided it altogether with hacks - productivity hacks.

So began my long relationship with personal productivity. Back then it wasn't
quite the global enterprise it is today - one that commands a lot of influence.
Sadly the people wielding that influence seem to suffer from the Kardashain
effect - they are productive at creating content about productivity[^1]. My
journal entries from that period (journalling, too, was something that mindful
and productive people recommended - I didn't start enjoying it until much later)
are full of whining about how I couldn't get enough done. Ultimately, many
books, articles, podcasts and videos later, I gave up on productivity hacks[^2].

This was the second time something broke. All hacks broke. Routine broke.
Habits, albeit with a lot of effort, broke. The only "hack" that remained was to
work with depth and focus at a slow and steady pace. It worked well enough for
me to do some of my best work: I went back to school and took some backbreaking
courses. I broke records at work - beat industry benchmarks, designed and built
systems that help millions of people. My wife and I built a forever home and
raised a dog. After all this, there were two things I thought I'd never go back
to - complaining about lack of time and productivity hacks.

And then after six years of working from home, I got a new job. This time at a
company that had an office nearby. My office used to be twenty feet from my
bedroom - now it was a twenty minute drive away. I know, a twenty minute commute
in Delhi is a goddamn luxury compared to what most people have to do. But when
you've been working from home for that long, every step outside is tiring.
Moreover, my new job was with a young company - for most of my colleagues it was
their first job. They were a highly energetic bunch with whom I had to really
work to keep up. It was like starting to go to a gym after a long gap -
exhausting but refreshing. The feeling of intense upheaval lasted about a month;
and was fortunately buffered by the excitement of a new job, new colleagues, new
office, and the sastisfaction of having an entirely new realm of programming
problems to solve. On the other hand, everyone at home - my wife, dog and the
help - had to get accustomed to me not being around. My dog was the worst hit -
in the first few weeks she lost her appetite. She had spent her entire life
lounging in my home office; either under my desk or on the sofa. She doesn't
mind staying there alone, but I could tell that she missed me being in that
room. For my house help, this meant extra hours (and also a raise) to
accommodate my schedule. For my driver, it mean juggling both my and my wife's
commute. My routine seemed like it had broken irreparably once again. Whatever I
had learned from my meanderings in time management and personal productivity
over the last six years seemed to have been overfitted to someone who works from
home. Now I had to rebuild it all over again.

Against this backdrop I saw the famous clip of S. N. Subrahmanyan, the L&T
chairman, wondering how long spouse can stare at each other. He wanted people to
work 90 hours a week. His comments came close on the heels of Narayana Murthy's
recommendation of a 70 hour workweek. These gentlemen are clearly very smart and
very successful. They both come from humble backgrounds. So it stands to reason
that they know what they are talking about. I'm sure that between them, they can
write volumes on productivity hacks.

As for myself, I wonder what I would have to do to work 90 hours a week. Not
starting at one's wife is perhaps, while initially painful, a manageable
productivity hack. But that doesn't me save too much time because my wife
herself is not sitting around waiting to be stared at. And moreover, we are once
again seeing each other only at dinner. Well, I could skip dinner. I could sleep
less. I could walk my dog only once a day. I could drink my morning coffee
during the commute instead of in my living room. I don't need multiple hours for
my hobbies r exercise either. There certainly is a lot of time to be saved, but
I know the cost. I know exactly what I would have to give up in order to work 90
hours a week.

Let's take a look at what other people would have to give up in order to work
that long.
