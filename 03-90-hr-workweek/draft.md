Writing prompts:

* The cosmic ulcer... Having not to decide what to wear or eat. Fixing doorknobs
  and choosing decoration.
* Interruptions and productivity.
* Being a good daughter-in-law.
* What do people have to take away from their schedule to have a 90 hr workweek?
* Being responsible for other living beings.

She: When I say, let's do the small doable things like changing doorknobs - why
can't you just be like, 'Yeah, let's do that!'

He: There are an infinite number of doable things. Impossible things, on
the other hand are very few. Therefore, anything can be called doable - there's
nothing special about most things that are considered doable.

She (hysterical by now): Why can't you just change the broken doorknob
in your bathroom?

He: I could just as well change door stoppers, hinges and the taps in the house.
Where does it stop? All of these are doable.

She: But none of them are _required_.

He (sensing that he's losing the argument, and trying to deflect): No, no...
let's first deal with this concept of the 'doable'. (Invoking Oliver Burkeman)
The human life is insultingly short. Just because things are doable does not
mean they ought to be done.

She (with infinite hopelessness): So you're not fixing the doorknob of your own bathroom?

Hi: Woh kya khazana hai jo kadi aur tala lagaun?

I don't think a lot of non-programming people understand flow and uninterrupted
immersion. Most of the gen pop is unsympathetic and oblivious to it. Even
spouses, unfortunately. In social conversation, it's so hard to defend not
fixing a doorknob. -- A Friend

## [June Huh's story](https://www.quantamagazine.org/june-huh-high-school-dropout-wins-the-fields-medal-20220705/)

On any given day, he does about three hours of focused work.
“Doing something that’s valuable, meaningful, creative” — or a task that he
doesn’t particularly want to do, like scheduling those appointments — “takes
away a lot of your energy.”

It took Huh six years to graduate.

June Huh is the poster child of slow productivity.
This brings in Cal Newport and perhaps even Richard Hamming

The shape of the prior:

1. Starts with Richard Hamming about neglecting stuff sometimes, to achieve
   great things. Sending this article to Aditi and her reaction.
2. Then John Steinbeck
3. Years later, I'm not fixing doorknobs and not spending enough time with her.
4. June Huh is who we all want to be.
5. And when I do get my leisure - I don't know what to do with it.

Even if I wanted to spend an inordinate amount of time with Aditi, India's
coroprate leaders don't like that. The head honco of L&T wants his employees
to work 90 hours a week. The CEO of Infosys wants his employees to work 70
hours a week. The L&T guy doesn't want people staring at their spouses.

How much time _do_ people have exactly?!
