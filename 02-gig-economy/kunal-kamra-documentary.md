Siddharth Dey's post came on the same day.

Kunal Kamra quoted a tweet by Albinder Dhindsa on 31st Dec 2024, asking what the
average wages of gig workers were. Dhindsa deleted his tweet.

Kamra's first tweet in the new year was about exploitation of gig workers.

* Biju Mathew talks about the spectrum of employee-employer relationships - also
  the spectrum spanning from employees on one hand to independent contractors on
  the other. An example is a plumber as an independent contractor - you only
  tell them the _what_, not the _how_. They decide their process and use their
  own tools to get the job done. The courier is an employee. All their processes
  and methods (logistics, etc) are determined by the courier company. Where on
  this spectrum do gig workers fall? It's not easy to say. What the Ubers and
  Swiggy's have done is to smash a well organised, a well regulated industry with technology, and
  then open up the space for negotiations. Mathew's point seems to be that
  they're opening up to discussion _after_ the disruption. There's an entire
  framework around labour benefits, and for good reason - ranging from social
  security benefits, greivance mechanisms to how they can get fired. Those were
  hard won victories. NYC won a bunch of rights against Uber and Lyft. They
  (aggregators) were banned from putting more cars on the road. They agreed to pay
  a large sum back - very publicly so - a sum that had been gradually skimmed
  off from drivers, into the unemployment insurance funds. Multiple governments
  in India are scrambling to be the first to put gig workers' rights into the
  law. It's been a part of many election manifestos. Rahul Gandhi made gig
  workers a part of the Bharat Jogo yatra. That's significant. They're being
  noticed.
* Rakshita Swamy - The administration and management is not done on a factory floor or an office - it's all happening
  on a digital platform. (There's a sense of opacity here. Perhaps Neil Postman
  might have something to say about this.) The intermediaries argue that they
  are just a bridge between the customer and the service providers, and are thus
  under no obligation to provide any benefits or security to the workers,
  especially those mandated by labour laws. They have to work much longer, much
  harder, just to earn basic income. They're called "partners" FFS, not
  employees. They lose a whole set of rights - related to income, safety and
  health - which would otherwise be recognized. Although not specific to India,
  it's all over the world. Rakshita also comments at length at the Kafkaesque
  absurdity of greivance redressal even on the side of the consumers - you're
  chatting with a bot which has templatized responses. Both workers and
  consumers have to settle for whatever the "platform" decides. The appelate
  system is supposed to be independent, not a part of the platform itself! The
  biggest greivance people have is blocking of IDs. These are poorly addressed.
  Workers don't often have a chance to contest termination of contract.
  Unionized (even loosely so) workers are being targeted by the platforms.
  Digital platforms come under MIETY - the nodal ministry is the IT ministry.
  Uber isn't a transport company, e.g. Which means that the workers have no
  nodal recourse. So the labour ministry is left to deal with all this.
* Babu Mathew - It is the aggregators's version of who is a gig worker that is incorporated in
  the [social security code of 2020](https://labour.gov.in/sites/default/files/ss_code_as_introduced_in_lok_sabha.pdf).
  There's a whole chapter on it. What's crept into the code is the aggregators'
  definition of gig work. It's a half-hearted and inadequate attempt. We need
  new legislation. A submission was made to the Karnataka government in 2023.
  FFS [the code says that](https://www.deccanherald.com/india/karnataka/govt-plans-per-transaction-cess-for-gig-workers-welfare-3193516#)
  the aggregator should pay no more than 5% of the amount paid or payable to the worker!
  Both the EU and the ILO have been addressing misclassification of workers. The
  whole point of this is that you can't use simply terminology to deprive
  workers of their rights. "Workers are workers - that's the presumption. If you
  want to challenge that, the burden of proof is on the employer." He also
  mentions the contracts that Rakshita talked about, and quotes the Indian
  contract law - "An unconscionable contract is no contract at all." - section
  16 of the Indian Contract Law. A contract holds only when there's a free
  exchange of ideas and terms and negotiations. This is exactly the phase that
  Biju Mathew alleges has been subverted by aggregators. They first disrupt, and
  then rewrite the rules of engagement to their own benefit. Doesn't the social
  security code prove this? Whoa... Mathew also alleges that exemptions were
  granted _by the cabinet against the advice of the labour secratariat_ to the
  **IT Sector**! Anyway, blocking of IDs based on some random decision can be
  challenged in court. It is something that the employer does under the terms of
  an unconscionable contract, and is therefore illegal - if a petitioner chooses
  to challenge it, i.e. Rajasthan, Karnataka and Telangana are fighting against
  the social security code. "Law is an instrument of social change."

In this meeting where we see Swamy and Banjara addressing a bunch of workers -
what was Kamra doing there?

* The Rajasthan government in 2023 was the first state in India to pass a act
  which extended social security benefits to gig workers.



### What the workers actually say

* Even though they're touted as "flexible working hours", they are anything but.
  Fleet managers insist that people remain online for extremely long hours. The
  workers can't escalate this easily since there's no office, as such, and their
  only contact is the manager themself.
* Not allowed to use lifts in buildings.
* Loyalty isn't rewarded. There's no upside to sticking to a platform for years.
  In fact aggregators might actually penalise you for being around for too long.
  It's easy for them to get fresh workers.
* Wapsi mein khali ana padega - can't refuse the ride, can't afford the fuel.
* Khana thanda ho gaya hai.
* Neta mat bano. Kaam nahi karna hai to mat karo.
* Cab drivers aren't respected by those who drive private cars. It's an implicit
  assumption that they're reckless drivers.
* Partner hain toh liability bhi share karo, not just profits.


### Other interesting facts
* Amazon workers travel hundreds of times around the world during the sales
  festivals.
* In the 80s, finance capital dominated the markets. Since the 2000s, PE capital
  started becoming strong.
* I wrote about someone "taking a club" to something. Jack London said that too,
  in essays of revolt. Find out what that was and use it here.


### Finally

There's nothing substantive that has come out of any state or the central
government. The bills are all stuck in limbo.

Also, Dhruv Rathee's video has a bunch of interesting stuff.
