True. They have. If you have a bank balance, a UPI account, an urban location
and a smartphone, life can be very easy indeed. Heck, I've stopped carrying my
wallet.

Why? Is "gig workers" somehow derogatory? Do they need a glorified designation
for them to be respected? The second sentence is a sweeping generalization.
Where did this figure of 15-45k come from? Are we sure that those that didn't
face this problem are earning well?

Agreed. We shouldn't always dwell on the negatives. And by the way, strikes and
dharnas at Gandhi park are still frequent. You moved out of Uttarakhand  in 2020,
didn't you? And how in the world did you end up from strikes in Gandhi park to
the three key factors? The startup economy boom actually contributes only 4% to
India's GDP. And we're not even talking about employment numbers here. It's a
pretty vague claim that reduced strikes in Gandhi park are because of all this.
First of all, there aren't reduced strikes at all!

Dude what are you even talking about? These vague changes being far more
impactful than an economy driven by content creation or entertainment? What does
that even mean? It's not even comparing apples to oranges, it's like comparing
apples to the Great Wall of China. What changes are to be celebrated?

Of course you truly feel that. You don't know better. Say more vague positive
sounding things, please.

What is transformative about this? Let's say what you're talking about is jobs
and money. Fine. I will agree with you that this is indeed transformative (not
just for privileged people like us, but for everyone). But wait until I get more
data. There will be a reckoning.

Three utterly unqualified claims, said with such immense confidence that it
almost sounds true.

That is true. Gig economy might well have saved people from starvation and
brought people back from the brink of the poverty trap.

Let's look at this a bit more carefully. How did call centers affect
unemployment rates?

> People like Kunal Kamra criticised call centers. 

Find the common criticisms levelled against call centers.

Look at govt job vacancies to find how much deficit there is. If the various
staate and central govt agencies wanted, would they be able to absorb these
people _en masse_? And let's really look at the data - are these people really
school dropouts?

Maybe, maybe not.

The photo in the post is a swiggy delivery agent in rains, wearing a raincoat,
on a cycle, driving close to a divider on a busy road. What a life! OP seems
oblivious to the fact that this is a dangerous job.
