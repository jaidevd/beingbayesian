My dog hates electric scooters. They are among the few things that can pass
within inches of her without making a sound, and that annoys her to no end.
Whatever noise it does make is a high pitched whine like a dog whistle.
Everytime one gets too close without her knowing, she lunges at it snarling and
growling. The riders grin stupidly and drive off, as my dog almost tears my arm
off trying to chase them down. I calmly shake my head at her, telling her that
it's her fault. She could have been paying better attention to the road instead
of walking with her nose glued to the ground.

I started driving when my dog was a year old, and a small part of her contempt
for electric scooters started creeping into me. I started understanding why she
hates them so much. It's not just the noise, it's the riders too. It occurred to
me that getting mad at them for quietly invading her space is perhaps not her
fault at all. It's not just the noise - it's the riders too. Like my dog, even
the riders are rarely looking at the road. They're looking at their phones, at
house numbers, at people standing on the first and second floor balconies -
anythere but the road. In traffic, they're straight-up reckless. They accelerate
too fast, sway from side to side, brake too hard, and don't hesitate to drive on
the wrong side of the road. You indicate you want to turn left or right, and
they'll end up in your blind spot with remarkable precision. Everytime I yell an
obscenity at them while driving, I can feel my dog rolling her eyes at me.
Earlier, dogs had a peculiar disdain for postmen, now they have it for delivery
~boys~ executives.

Strangely, all of that becomes irrelevant when they bring me stuff. It doesn't matter
how many vehicles they've cut off or how many dogs they've annoyed. I'm never
anything but polite to a stranger who brings me food. I make it a
poin to address them by name, I thank them and tip them. If it's too hot or raining,
ask them if they want some water. I also tell them that they're welcome to wait
the bad weather out in my verandah. Making this offer pissess my dog off all the
more, her eyes show an unmistakeable sense of betrayal.

Basically, my attitude towards gig workers is a fairly uniform distribution of
emotions - scattered evenly between generosity and irritation. And I'm sure
that's how most people treat them. Most people are... just regular humans: kind,
generous and irritable in equal measure. The polite will look them in the eye
and smile at them. The sociable will strike conversations with cab
drivers in a new city; the tardy will ask them to jump traffic lights.
The indecisive will ask waiters for recommendations and
the large-hearted will tip generously.

And then there are the 'influencers' who can't let so much as a fly buzz past
without photographing it and captioning it on LinkedIn with a motivational quote.
