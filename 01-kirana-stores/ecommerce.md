I was seven when the first supermarket opened in my hometown. It was around the
time when Coca-Cola returned to India after nearly 15 years. Both these things
together - the first supermarket and Coke's return - seemed to get the grown-ups
excited. They'd never been too pleased about soft drinks or junk food. And so an
unusual family outing was planned. There was a crowd outside the Coca-Cola
stall. My parents even ran into some friends and their kids, which made it all
the more weird - a supermarket wasn't the kind of place where elders met for a
get-together. I remember feeling really disappointed at my first bottle of Coke.
I'd had soda before, but this one tasted like shit. I had yet to discover the
link between fried, salty food and carbonated drinks. But everyone else,
especially the elders seemed to like it. So I pretended to like it too.

I grew fond of the supermarket, as it slowly replaced the neighbourhood grocery
store. I forgot the name and the face of the local grocer, who was fast
approaching the designation of "my grandfather's grocer". Supermarket visits
were exciting because it was fun to push the shopping cart. It was easy to sneak
packets of chocolate and potato wafers into the cart. They'd be discovered only
at checkout, by which time a parent would be too hassled to not buy it.

Today, the only time I go to a grocery store is if I'm visiting something near
one. I've stopped going to supermarkets too - I'm completely dependent on
BigBasket and Blinkit. What's really surprising is that my parents use these
apps too. When they first visited me in Delhi, one of the first things they
asked me was directions to the nearest grocery store. I didn't know what to tell
them. Their eyebrows disappeared when I told them where the groceries really
came from.

"Even the fruits, vegetables, milk and eggs?!"

"Yes."

"How do you know they're not stale?"

"Well, as long as they don't stink..."

They gave each other the hopeless look that all children know so well.

I come from a long line of late adopters. Simon Sinek [described](https://youtu.be/qp0HIF3SfI4?t=670) late adopters as
the people who'd only buy a touch-tone phone because nobody would repair a
rotary phone. That's exactly who my parents were. But now, post-COVID, they're
different people. They're older, they've lost some of their mobility, and their
sons don't feel too enthusiastic pushing carts down the supermarket aisle. Now,
they are quicker to use Blinkit than me. My mother even talks about instant
delivery apps as if she discovered them.

If a bunch of apps can change my mother's shopping habits - they can do
anything.

In the past year alone, we have enough evidence of e-commerce changing the
market. In 2024, Swiggy went public, Zepto raised half a billion dollars, and
Flipkart and Bigbasket started operating in a visibly better manner. In April
2024, Blinkit announced that they'd deliver a PlayStation 5 in ten minutes. To
me the idea was outrageous. As anyone from the erstwhile pre-liberalisation
middle class knows, buying expensive items is a ritual. Buying costly appliances
in just ten minutes - without months of research and penny pinching - is just
disrespectful.

I asked a lot of people about the most expensive thing they'd bought off an
insta-delivery app. I couldn't find anyone who'd spent more than a few thousand
rupees. A few people said they'd ordered protein powder or a video game
controller or a game (not the console itself). Relatively the most expensive
item I encountered was a UPS my wife bought for her office.

But who would actually need a PlayStation delivered in ten minutes?

I spoke to [Deepak "Chuck" Gopalakrishnan](https://linkedin.com/in/chuckofalltrades) about this. According to him,
extravagant offers are more marketing signals than revenue drivers - if someone
claims they can deliver gaming consoles in ten minutes, then they can certainly
deliver groceries in time. Perhaps, it takes signals like these to reach late
adopters like my parents. Many other customers like myself will sell their
loyalty to a brand for a lot less. Quick commerce to me is no longer a luxury,
but an unequivocal default, a habit.

So when someone on LinkedIN said that [e-commerce apps are destroying traditional
kirana stores](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7290602148533321728/), I wasn't surprised. On the contrary, I was sympathetic. The post
claimed that nearly 2,00,000 kirana stores had shut down in the last year
because of the 'predatory' practices of e-commerce companies. That's not a small
number. It means that the lives of at least 2,00,000 proprietors have been
affected - not to mention those of their staff and families. It won't be a
stretch to say that at least a million people could have been affected by this,
either directly or indirectly.

But in a swift change of tone, the post went on to offer some solutions which,
at best, seemed like a rehash of management consulting jargon, and at worst,
sounded condescending. The post suggested that kirana stores can bridge the gap
with "tech integration", "omni-channel presence", "customer experience",
"training and upskilling", etc. Not only does this sound disingenuous by itself,
but when used in the context of grocery stores, it also comes across as
downright unprincipled. I wish someone would say these phrases out loud in a
kirana store and record the reactions. The post was clickbait to begin with. The
caption had the words "SHOCKING DATA" in the thumbnail, in a large font,
complete with the picture of an old man sitting behind the counter of a
customer-less store - only his face visible between jars of confectionery and
overhanging packets of chips.

Clearly, something was being sold to the reader. When a less-than-sincere sale
is coupled with clickbait, there's always something interesting under the hood.

## Under the Surface

The OP had cited no sources, even though they were a quick Google search away.
In October 2024, the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation
(AICPDF) reportedly wrote to various government bodies, including the
Competition Commission of India (CCI), complaining of the (allegedly) predatory
practices of e-commerce companies. Their letters or press releases aren't
directly available, but many media outlets have independently reported their
claim of [2,00,000 kirana stores shutting down in the last year](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/aicpdf-claims-rise-of-quick-commerce-economic-pressures-have-led-to-kirana-store-closures/article68805343.ece). It's safe to say
that this entire discussion stems from an unverified claim.

But when we read the details of this claim, the picture becomes less bleak. The
country apparently has 13 million kirana stores. So 2,00,000 of them shutting
down is a 1.5% reduction. Further, if we were to limit the numbers only to
metros, the closure rate rises only up to 5%. It would be tempting to think that
this is a small fraction, but that may be a mistake, since we don't know what
the usual rate of closures under healthy market conditions is - we don't know
what the default benchmark is. It's quite likely that the OP is right, and that
5% kirana stores shutting down in metros is indeed "SHOCKING DATA".

But the claim that this is happening solely because of e-commerce companies is
certainly not beyond reasonable doubt. So I went looking for something that
would help me find the general, average success rates of kirana stores.

Sadly, I could find no such resource. What I did find was that kirana stores are
no strangers to threats from e-commerce.

There are enough reports dating back to the 2010s which show that there have
been [concerns about supermarket chains](https://mobilityforesights.com/product/offline-grocery-market-in-india/) damaging Kirana stores (it was the heyday
of Big Bazaar and D-Mart). Then in the late 2010s, Amazon and Flipkart became a
concern, but they didn't manage to displace more than 1-2% of local stores. Even
when the lockdown came, e-commerce managed to displace about only half a percent
of kirana stores. In this light, it's reasonable to assume that while the figure
of 2,00,000 looks big - it's certainly not an outlier. It is also noteworthy
that as much as there is concern towards e-commerce, there are also stories of
the triumph of kirana stores! PhonePe claimed, in 2021, to have [digitized 25
million "kirana stores and small merchants."](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/sme-msme-tech-phonepe-says-it-has-digitised-25-million-kiranas-merchants-in-india-2379513/)

By now it's clear that grocery stores have survived many threats. In business
(especially one as price-sensitive as FMCG retail) as well as in technology,
nearly every decade brings a new supposed threat. Morgan Housel wrote in is
book, _Same as Ever_, "It's good to always assume the world will break about once
per decade, because historically it has."[^1] But decade after decade, kirana
stores seem to have been remarkably resilient.

![](geralt-of-rivia.jpg)

But no matter how much of a threat or opportunity anyone may believe e-commerce
to be, the discourse so far has been purely theoretical - based only on claims,
counterclaims and conjecture. There are bigger issues to resolve, like
identifying the true impact of e-commerce on grocery shopping. To answer this,
we turn to the Household Consumption and Expenditure Survey (HCES).

## Digging Deeper

HCES 2023-24 was conducted between August 2023 and July 2024. The survey
interviewed nearly a million individuals across almost 2,50,000 representative
households[^2]. A major part of the survey deals with groceries[^3], including some
auxiliary information on payment methods and use of welfare schemes.

It is only in the context of the HCES microdata that I found the caption
"SHOCKING DATA!" to be truly justified. For instance, **only 7% of households in
the country shop online for groceries!**[^4] And of those households, more than half
are located in metros and a few Tier-I cities, across only four states.

![](online-grocery-shopping.png)

Online grocery shopping is a predominantly urban phenomenon, and saying even
that is a stretch. A whopping 83% of even urban households don't shop online!
Recall AICPDF's claim of 5% of kirana stores shutting in metros. The numbers are
far too lopsided on the side of traditional grocery shopping to consider
e-commerce as a serious threat. Other than traditional grocery stores, the
survey also contains details of other ways in which consumers can procure
groceries, like subsidized rations, the Public Distribution System and the
Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana.

In short, simply shopping online or offline for groceries, with cash or with UPI
isn’t the end of the story. The survey reveals such a great diversity in what
and how Indians eat, that it's almost impossible to pinpoint the habits of an
average Indian grocery shopper. For those of us who, like [Amit Tandon says](https://x.com/amitandon/status/1880138635607241170),
order the bread after they break the eggs, who instinctively look for a QR code
whenever we buy something from a brick-and-mortar store, it's impossible to
imagine who the "offline consumer" really is.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25852263-a447-4ef0-a63d-29d2cc235219_640x360.gif)

The HCES allows us to divide the respondents into cohorts of online and offline
shoppers. The imbalance between the sizes of these cohorts is staggering (7%
online vs 93% offline!), but when we adjust for size, we find some significant
markers of difference. For example, living in a home which has access to piped
cooking gas makes you four times more likely to shop online than if you cooked
with firewood, biogas or even LPG. When we move from the cohort of graduates to
postgraduates, the odds of finding online shoppers are doubled.

![](hces-range-chart.png)

In this light, the conflict between e-commerce and kirana stores seems to be
insignificant. In fact, it seems like the real conflict is between e-commerce
and lack of urban infrastructure, lack of quality education and massive income
inequality.

Consider this: if e-commerce can target no more than 7% of Indian households,
and if most Indians have [no discretionary spending
power](https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/india-wealth-gap-consumption-study-2025-blume-125022800468_1.html) -
then who's the one who is _really_ in trouble?

Certainly not the kirana store.

The well meaning folk who urge traditional stores to "bridge the gap" with "tech
integration" and "omni-channel presence" might be better off directing their
wisdom elsewhere.

## Zooming Out

Even with all the number crunching, we're still looking at consumers simply as
weighted sums of statistical attributes. The real Indian consumer still remains
elusive, if there even is such a thing. The common consumer, then, becomes a
mere metaphor in public discourse.

The Marathi movie Half Ticket shows such a metaphor. It's a story of two young
slum-dwellers who steal eggs from crows' nests, because they can't afford
chicken eggs. The park from where they get these eggs is sold off and turned
into a pizza joint. The kids then get obsessed with eating a pizza. They work
odd jobs for weeks, trying to save up the 300 rupees for a pizza. Finally when
they're ready to order one, they realise that it can't be delivered to their
home, because their address is simply the name of the jhuggi where they live.
They have no house number and no street name[^5]. When they visit the store,
they're humiliated and thrown out because of their appearance. They go back to
work and save more money to buy better clothes. When they return to the store
they're thrown out once again - the guard knows they are slum dwellers. The
movie does have a happy ending, the kids do get their pizza, but only because
someone thinks that feeding a couple of poor kids is good PR. They have baggage
that, even with money and clean clothes, cannot be jettisoned.

It's like there's an [entirely different country](https://youtu.be/PrHKt0HjmjA) living within India. I myself am
squarely in the 7%, and there's a whole world out there which I'll never see, no
matter how hard I look.

But I certainly wouldn't presume to sell anti-e-commerce solutions to kirana
stores. Much less on social media of all places, with clickbait and alarmist
captions.
