Q: You said, surprisingly recently, that GPT4 was the dumbest model we'll ever have to use. But GPT4 can already outperform 90% humans at SAT, LSAT, GRE, etc. What can GPT5 do that GPT4 cannot?

– He admits that when we say these models are good, they don't capture every way in which human are good/useful.

Sama: People are going to be "blown away" by GPT5 and then they will want more. It will transform a lot of knowledge work but people / society will co-evolve.

- We didn't see this coming 5/10 years ago. (True).

> It's the first model to which I can ask a hard scientific / technical question and get a pretty good answer.
> GPT5 programmed snake games in seconds.

Self note: Is it actually that good at coding? Check the LLM arena; on tasks other than programming too.

Question from the Stripe CEO. By when will an LLM make a **significant scientific discovery**? (Not like Alphifold)
Ans: Next 2 years, but the definition of 'significant' matters. By late 2027, I'd bet that most people would agree this has happened.

* He still says we need to keep scaling the models!

### What is superintelligence?
A system that does better research than the whole OpenAI research team of a better job of running OpenAI than me.

### How do you build superintelligence?
Limiting factors: compute, data, algorithms.
* we're mostly limited by energy
* we're excited about synthetic data
* we're getting better at alogirithms

- He hasn't said anything yet at all.

What went wrong/right before GPT5? - No clear answer
> A kid born today will be smarter than AI. Ever.

> Can GPT8 cure cancer?

Dances around the question.

The doomsday scenario: If I believed AI would kill us all, I wouldn't be working on it.
