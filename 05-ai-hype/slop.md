In August 2025, in the Rajya Sabha, Aam Admi Party MP Raghav Chadha demanded
free access to generative AI tools for all Indians. Undeterred by the question
of who will pay for them, social media hailed Chadha's demand as revolutionary.
It was called "bold", "heroic", "a crucial step towards digital democracy" and a
way to wrest the AI revolution away from Silicon Valley. The irony of how any of
this will happen by purchasing subscriptions from companies already in Silicon
Valley is lost on LinkedIn's "Top Voices". Influencers who would otherwise balk
at affirmative action or public welfare schemes loved the idea of free AI
subscriptions. As much as Chadha's own party has been criticised for appeasement
and "freebies", his proposal on AI subscriptions was unanimously applauded. 

Notably, an earlier speech of Chadha from March 2025, one in which he highlights
the need for infrastructure and funding needed for indigenous AI research, went
relatively unnoticed. In India, where fewer than 10% of households own a laptop
or a computer and internet usage is concentrated among younger, urban, educated and
wealthy Indians, the economic utility of free ChatGPT or Gemini subscriptions is
dubious.

It is not only this kind of collective, misty-eyed delusion that obfuscates the
promise of AI. Even the most earnest estimates of AI's economic impact are
dubious. OpenAI's own charter defines AGI as "highly autonomous systems that
outperform humans at most economically valuable work"; but we don't have
consensus, even between aligned parties, on what constitutes economically
valuable work or outperforming humans. For instance, Hinton famously said
in 2016 that we should stop training radiologists because it was "completely
obvious" that deep learning would be able to outperform them in a decade. If that had
happened, it would have been a good example of both AI outperforming humans as
well as creating economic value. Today, however, the field of radiology is
thriving; in no small part because they have managed to integrate AI tools.
Hinton has acknowledged his error. But many in the community who've made similar
erroneous predictions show barely a soft backpedal—insisting instead that AI
was always meant to be a companion. This pattern shows up distressingly
often—claim that AI will replace humans at something or the other, and when it
turns out that there's no real _replacement_, insist that it was never meant in
that sense.

At the root of this confusion is the fact that terms like AI, AGI,
autonomous systems, superintelligence, etc. are all ill-defined. They all refer
to a very large set of technologies and computing paradigms that are loosely
similar to each other. Asking questions about the economic impact of AI is like
asking questions about the impact of computers or the internet—they certainly
start with a bang, but take decades to diffuse through the economy and show
tangible impact. Deep down, we understand this, but the FOMO around AI makes
us slip up. Take, for instance, Andrej Karpathy's response when asked about how
best to measure AI progress—he said that he was "almost tempted to reject the
question entirely" because it was so ill-posed. He admits that there will always
be jobs that are "amenable to automation sooner or later", but that there's no
interpretation of "AI" or "work" that leads us to a clear and significant
economic impact.

To his credit, Karpathy has refined his outlook to adjust to reality. Only three
years ago, he was having a _very_ different conversation with Lex Fridman. He
said he was bullish on our ability to build AGIs. Three years later he admits
(to Dwarkesh Patel) that he gets triggered by the noise about AI on social
media, and that AI agents are slop. At the end of the Fridman interview, he
predicts (correctly) that the cost of content creation will fall, and excitedly
muses what would happen when we can generate art on demand, and when there's
infinite of it. Today we have arrived at Studio Ghibli-style image generation.
All it has done is generate some short-lived amusement, and a whole lot of
long-term consternation. On-demand video generators show us fake videos of house
cats chasing lions away and stuff that need not have been faked at all, like
journalists polishing politicians' boots.

_Slop._
